title: OpenClaw Suspicious Session Spawn Activity
description: |
  Detects OpenClaw session_spawn events and related patterns that may
  indicate abuse of the agent session mechanism.  Rapid spawning of
  sub-agents or spawning agents with suspicious names may indicate
  an attempt to bypass security controls or establish parallel
  execution paths for malicious actions.
